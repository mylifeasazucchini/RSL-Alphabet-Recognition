# RSL-Alphabet-Recognition

This repository is primarily aimed to use Deep Learning to recognize the alphabets from the Russian Sign Language (RSL). 

# The core objectives of this mini-project are:
1. Achieving accuracy similar to what Deep Learning has brought to recognition of other sign languages such as the American Sign Language.
2. Handling data scarcity
